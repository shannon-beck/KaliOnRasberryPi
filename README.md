## Hardware used when building this guide: 
  
    * [Raspberry Pi 400 Computer Kit ~$100](https://www.adafruit.com/raspberrypi400) - this is the RPi in a keyboard that is such a neat, affordable platform.
    * 32-GB MicroSD card, specifically the [Silicon Power 3D NAND 32GB 2-Pack MicroSD Card with Adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07RSXSYJC/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_DJEP45BBQ4GTBKMSXHGW).
 
## Setup of the System:
